# Zuul

A boring textadventure.

## How to play

Install the latest [dotnet](https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download) or latest LTS version.

Open this directory (with the Zuul.csproj file) in the terminal and type:

```
dotnet run
or build it big guy
actually for me running it makes some text seem invisible it works fine if you build 
```


first 4 enemies
mummyworkshop and newlocation
without armor
attack = 10
bleed = 5

full gold armor 
attack = 4 
bleed = 5

also the newlocation enemies have 2 armor making them take 48 damage instead of 50
